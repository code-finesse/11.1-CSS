- The `@media` rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

    Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

    - width and height of the viewport
    - width and height of the device
    - orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
    - resolution
- In addition to media types, there are also media features
- Media features provide more specific details to media queries, by allowing to test for a specific feature of the user agent or display device.
    - For example, you can apply styles to only those screens that are greater, or smaller, than a certain width.

CSS Syntax

```css
// Example 1
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  body {
    background-color: lavender;
  }
}

// Example 2
@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

// Example 3
/* When the width is between 600px and 900px OR above 1100px - change the appearance of <div> */
@media screen and (max-width: 900px) and (min-width: 600px), (min-width: 1100px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 50px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 8px solid black;
    background: yellow;
  }
}
```

Common Breakpoints

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}
```
